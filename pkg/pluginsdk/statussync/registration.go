// RegistrationInputs exposes the keyed status pipeline to code that adds a resource type
// to it: policy plugins via PolicyPlugin.RegisterPolicyStatus, and downstream resource
// types via proxy_syncer.WithStatusRegistration. A registration builds its per-object
// report reduction and its just-in-time writer; the event handlers feeding them are
// attached only while this replica is leader.
//
// There is deliberately one struct for both entry points. They were separate types with
// identical fields, and a field added to one of them silently did not reach the other.

	// what enrolls it in the StatusSyncer's cache synchronization barrier.

	// event that re-enqueues the resource, and nothing but the writer's live-vs-desired
	// skip stops that cycle. CheckWriterIdempotent asserts it; run it in the registration's
	// tests, as the built-in writers do.
